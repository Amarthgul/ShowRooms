# ShowRooms

Models and templates for quickly kitbash/generate showrooms 

There are 3 styles of showrooms. 

* Consumer electronics. This style of showroom is modeled based on Apple's physical stores. 

* Fine art museum. 

* Artificat exhibition. 


## Maya

Maya project for the models.

The Maya files can be found in the `scene` folder, together with an `export` folder containing the `fbx` files. 

Note that the files have been edited on Maya 2023, and when opened on older version, it might prompt color management error. 
To avoid this issue (it doesn't actually affect the model, just look ugly), it is suggested to drag and drop the `.mb` file
into the scene, then use namespace editor to remove the prefix. 

Also be aware that the models are built to accommodate both game standard and motion picture standard. The topology may thus
look weird and uncanny. 

## Unity 

Unity project containing the prefab and templates.
